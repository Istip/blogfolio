            The Original website of{" "}
            <abbr title='www.meddison.eu'>Meddison Recruitment</abbr> was
            functioning very well! But there is always a{" "}
            <abbr title='Someimes two buts just like in this sentence.'>
              BUT
            </abbr>
            !
          </p>
          <p>
            Everytime the CEO needed to{" "}
            <abbr title='Create / Read / Update / Delete'>CRUD</abbr> a new post
            on the website, he was bind to me. Nothing could happen without me
            editing the markup. Doesn't matter how pretty was the frontend, he
            couldn't change. He is a business man, not a developer! Do'h!
          </p>
          <p>
            So everytime something needed to change that{" "}
            <abbr title='Poor him! ðŸ˜¢'>costed a lot for him</abbr>! So i
            reacreated everything, using React JavaScript with headless CMS
            bindness to outer backend territory. Now he could treat the essence
            of the portal from a single admin panel and we were{" "}
            <abbr title='Because that is what both developers and clients want!'>
              both happy!

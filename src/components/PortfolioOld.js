              was my first real client who contacted me with a plan. The CEO
              wanted to have a portal which would offer{" "}

                jobs in the Netherlands

              Okay. I said! But the thruth is that I was way too much shifted
              away from web developement!
            </p>
            <p>
              I started off everything with WordPress and playing with free
              themes. It gave an appealing result, but it was no fun for me!
              That is how I decided to recreate the whole website! I renewed my
              CSS and HTML knowledge, also adding some new doctrines from
              Bootstrap. Finally I got the result! Not only with a done website
              and money, but fulfiment! I have created something for a real{" "}
